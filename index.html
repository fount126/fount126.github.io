                      <br>
                      <br>
                      I graduated from the State University of New York Canton, with a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Technology. I
                      was top of my class with Cum Laude Honors. Academics were very important to me. I am currently an IT Administrator/Specialist at Tompkins

                      operable databases.

                            Took the initiative to go out and count all of the tech equipment on each of the 60 buses. I did this so that we would actually know
                            what we have and know what was actually working on each bus. This was a very important project because by doing this I figured that we
                            only had to order 4 units of a certain equipment instead of 14. This ended up saving the company over $400,000.

                            make an account which was then stored to the database so that it couldn't be duplicated. Once the account was made the user would
                            be able to make their vote on which person they would want to win the Presidential Election. Each user was only allowed to vote
                            once and could login at a later time to keep track of who is winning the election.
